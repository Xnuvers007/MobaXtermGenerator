4. **Encryption and Decryption:** The generator employs encryption and decryption functions to secure the license information. This ensures that license keys cannot be easily tampered with or duplicated by unauthorized users.

5. **Byte Array Manipulation:** The code includes methods for converting byte arrays to integers, strings, and vice versa. These conversions are essential for processing and representing the license data in the desired format.

6. **License Key Generation:** The core functionality of the generator is the `generateLicense` function. This function takes user-provided input, including the license type, username, version details, and user count, and generates a unique license key based on these parameters. The generated key is then encoded and secured.

Overall, the MobaXterm Generator is a crucial tool for managing licensing and access control for MobaXterm, ensuring that users receive the appropriate level of functionality based on their license type while maintaining the security of the licensing system.
